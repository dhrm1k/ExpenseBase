# ExpenseBase (v0.0.1)

Welcome to **ExpenseBase**, a simple desktop app built with Python and Tkinter to help keep track of your expenses! I originally created this for personal use because, let's be honest, digital payments make it way too easy to spend like crazy. This is an early version (v0.0.1), but Iâ€™d love for my friends, family, and anyone interested to give it a try.
